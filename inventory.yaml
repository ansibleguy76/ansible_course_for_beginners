# we make a group "ubuntu" which will contain our ubuntu containers
# use the https://github.com/ansibleguy76/ubuntu_ansible_docker_compose repo
# to deploy multiple ubuntu containers
# HOWTO :
# the whole idea is that you have a single ubuntu machine, where we will spinup multiple ubuntu containers
# register your host ubuntu ip-address, you will need it later
ubuntu:
  # group level vars
  vars:
      ansible_become_pass: Ansible12!  # required for sudo
      ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no' # bypass ssh fingerprint interaction
      ansible_host: 172.22.139.250 # adjust with you ubuntu host ip
      ansible_user: ansible
      ansible_ssh_pass: Ansible12!
  hosts:
    ubuntu1:
      ansible_port: 2201
    ubuntu2:
      ansible_port: 2202
    # ... add more
